# Test User Login to App bug with Facebook

Started from the [Facebook Tutorial on passportjs.org](https://www.passportjs.org/tutorials/facebook/)

## The problem:

Test users currently can't login to my app, so I created this repo demonstrating that that's true not only for my app but for any passport.js app.

## The expected outcome:

I should be able to login to an Facebook App with a test user (that is linked to that app.)


## How to setup the demo app:

Prequisites install Node.js and Npm from https://nodejs.org/en/. After that run this in the root directory of this app:

```
npm install
```

## How to run the demo app:

This demo app illustrates the above problem and can be run using:

```
npm start
```
